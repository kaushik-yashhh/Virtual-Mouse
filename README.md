# Virtual-Mouse

Here's a detailed description you can use for your Git repository, outlining the project's purpose, features, and setup instructions:

Virtual Gesture Control Mouse using Mediapipe and OpenCV
This project implements a virtual gesture-controlled mouse using a webcam, Mediapipe, and OpenCV. The application tracks hand gestures in real-time, allowing you to control your computerâ€™s cursor and perform mouse actions like clicking, dragging, and scrolling, without touching a physical mouse.

Features
Real-Time Hand Tracking: Uses Mediapipe's hand tracking module to detect and track hand movements accurately.
Gesture Recognition: Recognizes various gestures such as:
Move Cursor: Control the cursor position using your index finger.
Left Click: Perform a left-click by bringing the index and middle fingers close together.
Right Click: Perform a right-click by bringing the index, middle, and ring fingers close together.
Dragging: Initiate a drag-and-drop operation by touching the thumb and index finger together.
Scrolling: Control scrolling actions by moving your pinky finger up or down relative to your index finger.
Smooth Cursor Movement: Implements a smoothing function to reduce jittery cursor movements, providing a more natural user experience.
High FPS Performance: Optimized to run at high frame rates, ensuring smooth and responsive control.
