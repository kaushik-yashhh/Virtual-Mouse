# Virtual-Mouse
This project implements a virtual gesture-controlled mouse using a webcam, Mediapipe, and OpenCV. The application tracks hand gestures in real-time, allowing you to control your computerâ€™s cursor and perform mouse actions like clicking, dragging, and scrolling, without touching a physical mouse.
